1. Data Acquisition:
- Set up the hydrophone hardware to capture audio signals.
- Use appropriate libraries or APIs to interface with the hydrophone and retrieve audio data.

2. Preprocessing:
- Apply any necessary preprocessing techniques to the raw audio data, such as noise removal or filtering.
- Convert the audio data into a suitable format for further analysis.

3. Feature Extraction:
- Extract relevant features from the preprocessed audio data.
- Common features for sound wave analysis include frequency, amplitude, duration, and spectral characteristics.

4. Training:
- Prepare a labeled dataset of sound wave samples, where each sample is associated with a specific sound class or category.
- Use machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning models (e.g., convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks), to train a sound classification model.
- Train the model using the labeled dataset and the extracted features.

5. Sound Wave Identification:
- Apply the trained model to classify new, unseen sound wave samples.
- Pass the preprocessed audio data through the trained model to predict the sound class or category.
